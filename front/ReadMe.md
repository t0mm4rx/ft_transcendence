# Frontend of ft_transcendence

## Structure
- Webpack + Babel to compile JS
- webpack-dev-server to run the dev server
- underscore for the templates
- p5 for the game canvas
- backbone for the front-end
- SASS compiles everything in ./scss/ in ./dist/

## Scripts
- compile: compile the project for production
- compile-dev: compile the project for development
- serve: runs the dev server with auto-reload

## Files
- ./assets/: static ressources (images, fonts, SVGs...)
- ./dist/: a folder generated by webpack where everything compiled is put. You can't change anything here as it'll be replaced
- ./scss/: the SCSS sources for the website styling
- ./src/: the JS sources of the website
- ./templates/: the HTML parts of the website, injected by Backbone and underscore.js

## Todo
- [ ] Change icons
